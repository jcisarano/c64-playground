//this is similar to the "rasterbar_alternate_method" except that I have changed the way the counters work
//so they reset separately from each other. By doing that, I can create a rolling color effect
//so that the colors in the raster bar appear to move.

//The bars are nice and solid at the top and bottom on my emulator, set to PAL

//X used as a counter for accessing the color data
//Y used to store the rasterline for checks
//A used to store the current color

//Tweaking the max value for the X register will affect how quickly the colors appear to move, and in what direction.

//How the rolling effect works:
//Let Z be the difference between the start Y and max Y values. If the max X value is less than Z, the bar will 
//appear to roll up. If max X is greater than Z, it will appear to roll down. If they are the same, the colors will stand still.
