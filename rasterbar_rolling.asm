//this is similar to the "rasterbar_alternate_method" except that I have changed the way the counters work
//so they reset separately from each other. By doing that, I create a rolling color effect
//so that the color bars appear to move.

//Tweaking the max value for the X register will affect how quickly the colors appear to move, and in what direction.
