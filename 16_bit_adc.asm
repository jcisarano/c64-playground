//Another version of the 16-bit count/loop, this time using adc & sec
//This shows the basics of how the carry flag is used in addition/subtraction here.

//For addition, the carry flag will be set when your operation rolls over, that is, when the sum of your numbers is greater than 255
//Here, I'm using bcc to detect that and decide when to increase a high byte, allowing me to have a 16-bit result

//For subtraction, the carry flag must be set before the operation using sec. It is used for borrowing--
//if it is unset after your subtraction, it is time to decrement your high byte, as in the "countdown" section below
